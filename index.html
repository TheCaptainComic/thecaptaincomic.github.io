       <p>Hello, World, and welcome to my first website!</p>
       <p>This is your Captain speaking! This is just a temporary website for an IT course I am taking, so please forgive me if it's a bit sparse! I'll be adding to it over the next few months, so if you've found this site, maybe check back once in a while, yeah?</p>
