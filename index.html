                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>My name is Marshall Auckland. I was born in a fictional eastern European country that will remain unnamed for copyright reasons. My parents died in a fatal mongoose hunting accident when I was two-and-three-quarters years old. Their last words were <q>Help! Mongoose!</q>.The mongeese took pity on me and raised me as their own until I was ten years old, after which I ventured out into the world of man to become the world's greatest <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> trainer, like no one ever was. However, before I could complete my quest, I was waylaid by a wise old man who offered to teach me the ancient secrets of mystical Swiss super-karate, and I accepted.</p>
        
                    <p>Over the next decade I learned everything there was to know about super-karate, including how to enter the secret cow level by awakening the chi within my invisible eleventh fingernail. My final test was to defeat my master in single combat, but before I could begin the test, my master was assailed by the ghost of my adoptive mongoose father, who had died and become the leader of the undead anti-karate ninja cult known as Chrysanthymum. In self-defense, I was forced to kill him a second time using the secret ghost-hunting technique I learned from observing crickets late at night. In doing so I inadvertantly repaired the damaged mongoose resurrection cycle and brought peace to both my father and his entire species.</p>
        
                    <p>I now live in a hut located in the sixth plane of reality located above Boise, Idaho, where I spend my time meditating and fishing in order to catch the rare Eternity Fish, which is said to grant whoever eats it the power to see double-ghosts, which are the ghosts of ghosts that have been killed, in the hopes of being reunited with my mongoose father's double-ghost. Occasionally I venture to the planes below to visit the only remaining 7-11 in Boise, as I have systematically destroyed the other six, which were each controlled by a ruthless samurai warlord. I hope to one day die and be reincarnated as a mongoose so that I may become one with my adopted brethren.</p>

                    <h2>The Philosophy of Swiss Super-Karate</h2>
                    <p>Swiss Super-Karate is based on the control of the chi contained within one's ten fingernails, in the pursuit of unlocking one's invisible eleventh fingernail, which contains chi greater than the others and is the key to mastering the secret technique <strong>Ultimate Ghost Dispel</strong>. Ultimate Ghost Dispel, as the name suggests, allows the user to kill ghosts, causing them to ascend to the next plane of existence, where they become double-ghosts. This in turn begs seeking the legendary Eternity Fish, allowing one to <em>see</em> double-ghosts, though not kill them. My master was tragically struck down before he could finish developing the double-ghost killing technique Ultimate Double-Ghost Dispel, but I hope to one day complete his great work.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of my ten years of training in the art of super-karate, I was witness to many great feats performed by my ancient master, as well as privy to much of the great knowledge he gathered over his long life of -516 years. However, perhaps the greatest piece of wisdom my master ever shared with me was as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>"Question not why the mongoose's venom hurts your eyes. Question only why it bites your face. For if you learn the transgressions you have committed against it, and apologize for your actions, it will stop biting your face. Probably."</p>
                    <p>â€”Hungus Mungus, <cite>Treatise on Mongoose Bites</cite></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>My master was also well-versed in more traditional philosophy, and often shared his musings in public forums, though unfortunately most were not at his level of thought and could not comprehend his masterful waxings on the meanings of life, death, and the glass marbles you get in those little Japanese sodas you sometimes see in vending machines at Chinese buffets. I have attached one of his greatest writings, titled "waistcoat sartorial", <a href="docs/waistcoat-sartorial.pdf" download="waistcoat sartorial.pdf">here</a> for you to ponder and consider.</p>

                    <h2>The Seven Scions of 7-11</h2>
                    <p>While wandering the Idaho countryside after avenging my master and dispelling my adoptive mongoose father's ghost, I came across a travelling real estate agent who offered to sell me the home of my dreams, a single-story fishing hut located in the sixth plane of existence forever floating above Boise. However, in order to gain access to my home, I would have to defeat the Seven Scions of 7-11, a group of brutal samurai warlords who ruled all convenience stores in Boise with iron fists.</p>
        
                    <p>One by one, I challenged each of the Scions in turn, absorbing the chi from their eleventh fingernails upon their defeat and adding it to my own. Upon defeating each Scion, I gave them a customary Idahoan samurai burial, collapsing their 7-11 convenience store on top of them. However, upon reaching the seventh 7-11, I was surprised to learn that the seventh Scion was in fact the travelling real estate agent who had started me on my quest in the first place!</p>
        
                    <p>As the seventh Scion explained whilst I repeatedly slammed his head in a freezer door with excessive and wholly unnecessary force, the Seven Scions were once defenders of Boise, protecting it from both supernatural threats and supernatural nighttime hunger with their powerful chi and even more powerfully low prices. However, over time the other six Scions became corrupted by the power they held over the city's munchie-ridden populace, and began raising their prices until the people were forced to swear fealty to them and join their crew, relying on the coveted employee discounts to survive. With no hope of rebellion against his corrupted brethren, the final Scion posed as a real estate agent in order to lure me into defeating them, and restoring peace to the area. Thus, with the other Scions defeated and the way to my new home no longer blocked by their treacherous chi, I chose to spare the final Scion's life, in exchange for a lifetime 5% discount on all Hostess products.</p>
